# -Keymaster-Proposal-Add-Trusted-Developers-Sub-user-Accounts


This repository outlines a proposal for enhancing the FiveM Keymaster platform by allowing **project owners to assign trusted developers or sub-user accounts** with limited access and permissions.

## 🔧 Purpose

The goal is to improve project collaboration and streamline resource deployment by:
- Allowing team members to help manage assets without giving them full access to the owner's account
- Preventing security risks by isolating permissions per sub-user
- Making Keymaster more team-friendly and scalable for larger development teams

## 💡 Proposed Features

- Trusted Developer Roles with permission-based access
- Sub-user management interface
- Activity logs for sub-user actions
- Owner-controlled access revocation at any time
